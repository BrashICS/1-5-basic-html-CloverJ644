    <h2>Some information on Sea slugs</h2>

    <h4>What is a Sea slug?</h4>
    
    <p>
    The name <b>sea slug</b> refers to some marine invertebrates with a resemblence (on some level) to terrestrial slugs. <br> Most sea slugs are gastropods, sea snails that— over evolutionary time— have entirely or at least <i>seemingly</i> lost their shells. I say "seemingly" because some sea slugs have significantly reduced shells, and others have <i>internal</i> shells. For example, nudibranchs and some other marine gastropods without visible shells. (Note: despite looking like and often being <i>referred to as</i> sea slugs, sea cucumbers are not gastropods)

    <h4>Physiological Facts</h4>

    <p>
    Sea slugs come in an extremely wide variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. Most of them are partially translucent! The often bright colors of reef-dwelling sea slugs can be a good indicator of their toxic stinging cells (called <b>nematocysts</b>) or unpleasant taste. Like all gastropods, sea slugs have small, razor sharp teeth called <i>radulas</i>. <br> Most sea slugs have a pair of <b>rhinopores</b>— a type of chemosensory organ— on their head, each having a small eye on its base, and most have feathery structures called <i>cerata</i> on their backs, which act like gills. All genuine sea slugs have a selected prey animal that they rely on for food, which can include other members of their own species. Despite what you may think, sea slugs do, in fact, have brains! For example, <i>aplysia californica</i> (the California sea hare) has a brain of about 20,000 nerve cells!
